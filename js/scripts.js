// Business logic
// one constructor for each play (2 players)
// create a prototype for rolling dice 
// create a prototype to keep score during a turn - calls rolling dice until hold or 1 is reached, then calls add score if score is positive
// create a add score protoype (UI logic hold button)
// create prototype method that randomly generates what player goes first 
// 
// 
// 
// player1
// Score: score 
// total: total 
// conditional when total score of 100 is met, player is declared as winner 


// UI logic
// section for each player
// roll and hold button  
// append total score beneath player
